Hyper Minimal is a beautiful theme for the Hyper terminal based on the [Night Owl Hyper dark theme](https://github.com/pbomb/hyper-night-owl), which is optimized for working at night, accessibility, and colorblindness.

This code for this theme is based on the [Hyper Night Owl theme](https://github.com/pbomb/hyper-night-owl).

## üõ† Install

Installing the Hyper Minimal theme for your Hyper terminal couldn't be easier.

###### Install theme (Hyper)

1.  `git clone git@github.com:remondevries/Hyper-Minimal.git`
1.  Move the repo into the following location `.hyper_plugins/node_modules`.

###### Adjust Config

1.  Open `~/.hyper.js` in your favorite editor.
1.  Add `hyper-minimal` to the `plugins` array.
1.  Enjoy hyper-night-owl.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure

By default, it does not supply a transparent background, however, if you'd like to have this, I recommend installing and configuring the [hyper-opacity](https://hyper.is/plugins/hyper-opacity) plugin.
